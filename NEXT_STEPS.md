# üéØ Next Steps: Getting Your Booking System Running

Your booking system with **double-booking prevention** is now fully implemented! Follow these steps to get it running.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

The Supabase package needs to be installed:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install `@supabase/supabase-js` and all other dependencies.

## Step 2: Set Up Supabase Database

You already have a `.env` file with Supabase credentials. Now you need to create the database tables:

### Option A: Quick Setup (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://app.supabase.com
2. Find your project (URL: `nusnquvsugnwahlurgyo.supabase.co`)
3. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New Query**
5. Open the `supabase_schema.sql` file in your project
6. Copy **ALL** the contents
7. Paste into the SQL Editor
8. Click **Run** (or Ctrl+Enter)
9. Wait for "Success. No rows returned"

‚úÖ Done! All tables, indexes, and constraints are created.

### Option B: Detailed Step-by-Step

Follow the comprehensive guide in `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions with screenshots and troubleshooting.

## Step 3: Enable Realtime

For instant sync across devices:

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **Database** ‚Üí **Replication**
2. Scroll to **Tables** section
3. Enable replication for these tables:
   - ‚úÖ `bookings`
   - ‚úÖ `unavailable_dates`
   - ‚úÖ `time_slot_bookings` (NEW!)

**Or run this SQL:**
```sql
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE public.bookings;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE public.unavailable_dates;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE public.time_slot_bookings;
```

## Step 4: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## Step 5: Test the System

### Test 1: Basic Booking
1. Select a future date (not today)
2. Choose a time slot (e.g., 3:30-4:30 PM)
3. Fill in customer details
4. Submit booking
5. ‚úÖ Date should show the time slot as booked

### Test 2: Conflict Prevention
1. Try to book the same time slot again (3:30-4:30 PM)
2. ‚úÖ That time should not appear in the dropdown
3. Try 4:00-5:00 PM (overlaps with 3:30-4:30)
4. ‚úÖ Should not appear in dropdown

### Test 3: Non-Overlapping Bookings
1. Book 4:30-5:30 PM on the same date
2. ‚úÖ Should succeed (no overlap with 3:30-4:30)
3. Now both slots are booked on that date

### Test 4: Real-Time Sync
1. Open app on your phone (or another browser window)
2. Book a slot from your phone
3. ‚úÖ Within 1-2 seconds, your computer should show that slot as unavailable

### Test 5: Same-Day Blocking
1. Book any time slot for today
2. ‚úÖ Entire day should become unavailable (grayed out)
3. Try to book another time for today
4. ‚úÖ Should not be selectable

### Test 6: Employee Mode
1. Click "Employee mode" button
2. Enter code: `1123`
3. Click a date on the calendar
4. ‚úÖ Should see all bookings for that date
5. Click "Mark Unavailable"
6. ‚úÖ Date becomes unavailable on all devices

## What Changed

### New Features ‚ú®

1. **Time Slot Conflict Detection**
   - Frontend checks for overlaps before submission
   - Database constraint prevents race conditions
   - User-friendly error messages

2. **Smart Time Slot Filtering**
   - Dropdown only shows available times
   - Already-booked slots are hidden
   - Shows warning if all slots are taken

3. **Same-Day Blocking**
   - Any booking today blocks the entire day
   - Prevents confusion about availability
   - Clear visual indication (grayed out)

4. **Real-Time Sync Enhanced**
   - Now syncs time slot availability
   - All devices update within 1-2 seconds
   - No more double-bookings!

5. **Database-Level Protection**
   - Unique constraints prevent conflicts
   - Handles simultaneous booking attempts
   - Catches edge cases frontend might miss

### New Files Created

- **`supabase_schema.sql`** - Database schema with conflict prevention
- **`SUPABASE_SETUP.md`** - Complete setup guide
- **`BOOKING_SYSTEM.md`** - Technical documentation
- **`NEXT_STEPS.md`** - This file!

### Files Modified

- **`src/App.tsx`** - Added time slot conflict detection logic
- **`package.json`** - Added @supabase/supabase-js dependency
- **`SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - Updated with new features

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module '@supabase/supabase-js'"
Run: `npm install`

### "relation public.bookings does not exist"
Run the SQL schema in Supabase SQL Editor (Step 2 above)

### "Failed to load bookings"
1. Check `.env` file has correct credentials
2. Verify tables exist in Supabase
3. Check browser console (F12) for specific error

### Real-time not working
1. Enable Realtime for all three tables (Step 3 above)
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check Supabase dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Replication

### Time slots still showing after booking
1. Wait 1-2 seconds for real-time sync
2. Refresh the page
3. Check if `time_slot_bookings` table has the entry
4. Verify Realtime is enabled for `time_slot_bookings`

## Understanding the System

### How It Works

**Frontend (React App):**
- Loads all booked time slots from database
- Filters dropdown to show only available times
- Checks for conflicts before submission
- Subscribes to real-time updates

**Backend (Supabase):**
- Stores bookings in `bookings` table
- Tracks time slots in `time_slot_bookings` table
- Enforces unique constraint on time slots
- Broadcasts changes to all connected devices

**Conflict Prevention:**
1. UI filtering (removes booked slots)
2. Pre-submit validation (checks conflicts)
3. Database constraint (final safety net)

### Key Concepts

**Time Slots:**
- Stored as minutes since midnight (e.g., 930 = 3:30 PM)
- 1-hour duration with 30-minute increments
- Overlap detection: `(start1 < end2) AND (end1 > start2)`

**Same-Day vs Future:**
- Same-day: Entire day blocked
- Future: Multiple bookings allowed if no overlap

**Real-Time Sync:**
- All devices subscribe to database changes
- Changes broadcast within ~1 second
- UI updates automatically
