# ðŸš€ REAL-TIME SYNC & DOUBLE-BOOKING PREVENTION

## What This System Does

Your booking app now has **advanced double-booking prevention** that works across all devices:

âœ… **Same-day bookings:** Entire day blocks when booked  
âœ… **Future bookings:** Multiple per day allowed, but time slots can't overlap  
âœ… **Real-time sync:** All devices see updates instantly  
âœ… **Race condition protection:** Database prevents conflicts at the lowest level

## The Solution

Your app uses **Supabase** (cloud PostgreSQL database) with real-time sync and time-slot conflict detection.

## Quick Fix (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Your `.env` File

Create a new file named `.env` (no extension, just `.env`) in your project root folder (same location as `package.json`) with this content:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

### Step 2: Get Your Supabase Credentials

**If you already have a Supabase project:**
1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
2. Open your project
3. Go to Settings â†’ API
4. Copy the **Project URL** and **anon public** key
5. Paste them into your `.env` file

**If you DON'T have a Supabase project yet:**
Follow the complete setup guide in `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` (includes database table creation with double-booking prevention)

### Step 3: Restart Your Development Server

1. Stop your current dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Run: `npm run dev`
3. The app will now connect to Supabase!

### Step 4: Test Real-Time Sync

1. Open the app on your phone
2. Open it on your computer
3. Submit a booking from your phone
4. **Watch the dates become unavailable on your computer in real-time!** ðŸŽ‰

## What's Already Built In

Your app already has:
- âœ… Real-time subscriptions to `bookings` table
- âœ… Real-time subscriptions to `unavailable_dates` table  
- âœ… Automatic UI updates when data changes
- âœ… Proper database save operations

**All you need is the `.env` file with your Supabase credentials!**

## How Real-Time Sync Works

1. **When someone submits a booking:**
   - Data is saved to Supabase `bookings` table
   - Dates are added to `unavailable_dates` table
   - Supabase broadcasts changes to ALL connected devices
   - Your app receives the update and refreshes the UI
   - ðŸŽ¯ Result: All devices show the same data instantly!

2. **In Employee Mode:**
   - When you mark a date unavailable on one device
   - Supabase broadcasts the change
   - All other devices (phones, computers) update automatically
   - All bookings are visible on every device

## Common Issues

### "Can't see .env file in my folder"
Windows hides files starting with a dot by default. Create it using:
1. Open Command Prompt in your project folder
2. Run: `echo. > .env`
3. Then edit it with Notepad

### "Still not syncing after creating .env"
1. Make sure you **restarted the dev server** after creating `.env`
2. Check the browser console (F12) for connection errors
3. Verify your Supabase URL and key are correct

### "Need to set up Supabase from scratch"
See the complete guide in `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Created `.env` file with Supabase credentials
- [ ] Restarted dev server (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Opened app on two devices
- [ ] Submitted booking on device 1
- [ ] Dates became unavailable on device 2 immediately
- [ ] Opened employee mode (code: 1123) on both devices
- [ ] Marked a date unavailable on device 1
- [ ] Saw the update on device 2 in real-time
- [ ] Bookings visible on both devices

## Need Help?

Check the browser console (F12) for error messages. Common messages:
- "Invalid Supabase URL" â†’ Check your `.env` file
- "Failed to load bookings" â†’ Verify tables are created in Supabase
- No errors but not syncing â†’ Enable Realtime in Supabase dashboard

---

**TL;DR:** Create a `.env` file with your Supabase credentials, run the SQL schema, and everything will sync across all devices with double-booking prevention! ðŸš€
